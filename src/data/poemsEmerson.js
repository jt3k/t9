export default `Alphonso Of Castile
I Alphonso live and learn
Seeing nature go astern
Things deteriorate in kind
Lemons run to leaves and rind
Meagre crop of figs and limes
Shorter days and harder times
Flowering April cools and dies
In the insufficient skies
Imps at high Midsummer blot
Half the suns disk with a spot
Twill not now avail to tan
Orange cheek or skin of man
Roses bleach the goats are dry
Lisbon quakes the people cry
Yon pale scrawny fisher fools
Gaunt as bitterns in the pools
Are no brothers of my blood
They discredit Adamhood
Eyes of gods ye must have seen
Oer your ramparts as ye lean
The general debility
Of genius the sterility
Mighty projects countermanded
Rash ambition brokenhanded
Puny man and scentless rose
Tormenting Pan to double the dose
Rebuild or ruin either fill
Of vital force the wasted rill
Or tumble all again in heap
To weltering chaos and to sleep
Say Seigneurs are the old Niles dry
Which fed the veins of earth and sky
That mortals miss the loyal heats
Which drove them erst to social feats
Now to a savage selfness grown
Think nature barely serves for one
With science poorly mask their hurt
And vex the gods with question pert
Immensely curious whether you
Still are rulers or Mildew
Masters Im in pain with you
Masters Ill be plain with you
In my palace of Castile
I a king for kings can feel
There my thoughts the matter roll
And solve and oft resolve the whole
And for Im styled Alphonse the Wise
Ye shall not fail for sound advice
Before ye want a drop of rain
Hear the sentiment of Spain
You have tried famine no more try it
Ply us now with a full diet
Teach your pupils now with plenty
For one sun supply us twenty
I have thought it thoroughly over
State of hermit state of lover
We must have society
We cannot spare variety
Hear you then celestial fellows
Fits not to be over zealous
Steads not to work on the clean jump
Nor wine nor brains perpetual pump
Men and gods are too extense
Could you slacken and condense
Your rank overgrowths reduce
Till your kinds abound with juice
Earth crowded cries Too many men
My counsel is Kill nine in ten
And bestow the shares of all
On the remnant decimal
Add their nine lives to this cat
Stuff their nine brains in his hat
Make his frame and forces square
With the labors he must dare
Thatch his flesh and even his years
With the marble which he rears
There growing slowly old at ease
No faster than his planted trees
He may by warrant of his age
In schemes of broader scope engage
So shall ye have a man of the sphere
Fit to grace the solar year
Art
Give to barrows trays and pans
Grace and glimmer of romance
Bring the moonlight into noon
Hid in gleaming piles of stone
On the citys paved street
Plant gardens lined with lilacs sweet
Let spouting fountains cool the air
Singing in the sunbaked square
Let statue picture park and hall
Ballad flag and festival
The past restore the day adorn
And make tomorrow a new morn
So shall the drudge in dusty frock
Spy behind the city clock
Retinues of airy kings
Skirts of angels starry wings
His fathers shining in bright fables
His children fed at heavenly tables
T is the privilege of Art
Thus to play its cheerful part
Man on earth to acclimate
And bend the exile to his fate
And moulded of one element
With the days and firmament
Teach him on these as stairs to climb
And live on even terms with Time
Whilst upper life the slender rill
Of human sense doth overfill
Astra
Himself it was who wrote
His rank and quartered his own coat
There is no king nor sovereign state
That can fix a heros rate
Each to all is venerable
Capapie invulnerable
Until he write where all eyes rest
Slave or master on his breast
I saw men go up and down
In the country and the town
With this prayer upon their neck
Judgment and a judge we seek
Not to monarchs they repair
Nor to learned jurists chair
But they hurry to their peers
To their kinsfolk and their dears
Louder than with speech they pray
What am I companion say
And the friend not hesitates
To assign just place and mates
Answers not in word or letter
Yet is understood the better
Is to his friend a lookingglass
Reflects his figure that doth pass
Every wayfarer he meets
What himself declared repeats
What himself confessed records
Sentences him in his words
The form is his own corporal form
And his thought the penal worm
Yet shine for ever virgin minds
Loved by stars and purest winds
Which oer passion throned sedate
Have not hazarded their state
Disconcert the searching spy
Rendering to a curious eye
The durance of a granite ledge
To those who gaze from the seas edge
It is there for benefit
It is there for purging light
There for purifying storms
And its depths reflect all forms
It cannot parley with the mean
Pure by impure is not seen
For theres no sequestered grot
Lone mountain tam or isle forgot
But justice journeying in the sphere
Daily stoops to harbor there
Bacchus
Bring me wine but wine which never grew
In the belly of the grape
Or grew on vine whose taproots reaching through
Under the Andes to the Cape
Sufferd no savour of the earth to scape
Let its grapes the morn salute
From a nocturnal root
Which feels the acrid juice
Of Styx and Erebus
And turns the woe of Night
By its own craft to a more rich delight
We buy ashes for bread
We buy diluted wine
Give me of the true
Whose ample leaves and tendrils curld
Among the silver hills of heaven
Draw everlasting dew
Wine of wine
Blood of the world
Form of forms and mould of statures
That I intoxicated
And by the draught assimilated
May float at pleasure through all natures
The birdlanguage rightly spell
And that which roses say so well
Wine that is shed
Like the torrents of the sun
Up the horizon walls
Or like the Atlantic streams which run
When the South Sea calls
Water and bread
Food which needs no transmuting
Rainbowflowering wisdomfruiting
Wine which is already man
Food which teach and reason can
Wine which Music is
Music and wine are one
That I drinking this
Shall hear far Chaos talk with me
Kings unborn shall walk with me
And the poor grass shall plot and plan
What it will do when it is man
Quickend so will I unlock
Every crypt of every rock
I thank the joyful juice
For all I know
Winds of remembering
Of the ancient being blow
And seemingsolid walls of use
Open and flow
Pour Bacchus the remembering wine
Retrieve the loss of me and mine
Vine for vine be antidote
And the grape requite the lote
Haste to cure the old despair
Reason in Natures lotus drenchd
The memory of ages quenchd
Give them again to shine
Let wine repair what this undid
And where the infection slid
A dazzling memory revive
Refresh the faded tints
Recut the aged prints
And write my old adventures with the pen
Which on the first day drew
Upon the tablets blue
The dancing Pleiads and eternal men
Beauty
Was never form and never face
So sweet to SEYD as only grace
Which did not slumber like a stone
But hovered gleaming and was gone
Beauty chased he everywhere
In flame in storm in clouds of air
He smote the lake to feed his eye
With the beryl beam of the broken wave
He flung in pebbles well to hear
The moments music which they gave
Oft pealed for him a lofty tone
From nodding pole and belting zone
He heard a voice none else could hear
From centred and from errant sphere
The quaking earth did quake in rhyme
Seas ebbed and flowed in epic chime
In dens of passion and pits of woe
He saw strong Eros struggling through
To sun the dark and solve the curse
And beam to the bounds of the universe
While thus to love he gave his days
In loyal worship scorning praise
How spread their lures for him in vain
Thieving Ambition and paltering Gain
He thought it happier to be dead
To die for Beauty than live for bread
Berrying
May be true what I had heard
Earths a howling wilderness
Truculent with fraud and force
Said I strolling through the pastures
And along the riverside
Caught among the blackberry vines
Feeding on the Ethiops sweet
Pleasant fancies overtook me
I said What influence me preferred
Elect to dreams thus beautiful
The vines replied And didst thou deem
No wisdom to our berries went
Blight
Give me truths
For I am weary of the surfaces
And die of inanition If I knew
Only the herbs and simples of the wood
Rue cinquefoil gill vervain and pimpernel
Bluevetch and trillium hawkweed sassafras
Milkweeds and murky brakes quaint pipes and sundew
And rare and virtuous roots which in these woods
Draw untold juices from the common earth
Untold unknown and I could surely spell
Their fragrance and their chemistry apply
By sweet affinities to human flesh
Driving the foe and stablishing the friend
O that were much and I could be a part
Of the round day related to the sun
And planted world and full executor
Of their imperfect functions
But these young scholars who invade our hills
Bold as the engineer who fells the wood
And travelling often in the cut he makes
Love not the flower they pluck and know it not
And all their botany is Latin names
The old men studied magic in the flower
And human fortunes in astronomy
And an omnipotence in chemistry
Preferring things to names for these were men
Were unitarians of the united world
And wheresoever their clear eyebeams fell
They caught the footsteps of the SAME Our eyes
Are armed but we are strangers to the stars
And strangers to the mystic beast and bird
And strangers to the plant and to the mine
The injured elements say Not in us
And night and day ocean and continent
Fire plant and mineral say Not in us
And haughtily return us stare for stare
For we invade them impiously for gain
We devastate them unreligiously
And coldly ask their pottage not their love
Therefore they shove us from them yield to us
Only what to our griping toil is due
But the sweet affluence of love and song
The rich results of the divine consents
Of man and earth of world beloved and lover
The nectar and ambrosia are withheld
And in the midst of spoils and slaves we thieves
And pirates of the universe shut out
Daily to a more thin and outward rind
Turn pale and starve Therefore to our sick eyes
The stunted trees look sick the summer short
Clouds shade the sun which will not tan our hay
And nothing thrives to reach its natural term
And life shorn of its venerable length
Even at its greatest space is a defeat
And dies in anger that it was a dupe
And in its highest noon and wantonness
Is early frugal like a beggars child
With most unhandsome calculation taught
Even in the hot pursuit of the best aims
And prizes of ambition checks its hand
Like Alpine cataracts frozen as they leaped
Chilled with a miserly comparison
Of the toys purchase with the length of life
Boston
Sicut Patribus sit Deus Nobis
The rocky nook with hilltops three
Looked eastward from the farms
And twice each day the flowing sea
Took Boston in its arms
The men of yore were stout and poor
And sailed for bread to every shore
And where they went on trade intent
They did what freeman can
Their dauntless ways did all men praise
The merchant was a man
The world was made for honest trade
To plant and eat be none afraid
The waves that rocked them on the deep
To them their secret told
Said the winds that sung the lads to sleep
Like us be free and bold
The honest waves refuse to slaves
The empire of the ocean caves
Old Europe groans with palaces
Has lords enough and more
We plant and build by foaming seas
A city of the poor
For day by day could Boston Bay
Their honest labor overpay
We grant no dukedoms to the few
We hold like rights and shall
Equal on Sunday in the pew
On Monday in the mall
For what avail the plough or sail
Or land or life if freedom fail
The noble craftsmen we promote
Disown the knave and fool
Each honest man shall have his vote
Each child shall have his school
A union then of honest men
Or union nevermore again
The wild rose and the barberry thorn
Hung out their summer pride
Where now on heated pavements worn
The feet of millions stride
Fair rose the planted hills behind
The good town on the bay
And where the western hills declined
The prairie stretched away
What care though rival cities soar
Along the stormy coast
Penns town New York and Baltimore
If Boston knew the most
They laughed to know the world so wide
The mountains said Goodday
We greet you well you Saxon men
Up with your towns and stay
For you they said no barriers be
For you no sluggard rest
Each street leads downward to the sea
Or landward to the West
O happy town beside the sea
Whose roads lead everywhere to all
Than thine no deeper moat can be
No stouter fence no steeper wall
Bad news from George on the English throne
You are thriving well said he
Now by these presents be it known
You shall pay us a tax on tea
Tis very smallno load at all
Honor enough that we send the call
Not so said Boston good my lord
We pay your governors here
Abundant for their bed and board
Six thousand pounds a year
Your highness knows our homely word
Millions for selfgovernment
But for tribute never a cent
The cargo came and who could blame
If Indians seized the tea
And chest by chest let down the same
Into the laughing sea
For what avail the plough or sail
The townsmen braved the English king
Found friendship in the French
And Honor joined the patriot ring
Low on their wooden bench
O bounteous seas that never fail
O day remembered yet
O happy port that spied the sail
Which wafted Lafayette
Polestar of light in Europes night
That never faltered from the right
Kings shook with fear old empires crave
The secret force to find
Which fired the little State to save
The rights of all mankind
But right is might through all the world
Province to province faithful clung
Through good and ill the warbolt hurled
Till Freedom cheered and the joybells rung
The sea returning day by day
Restores the worldwide mart
So let each dweller on the Bay
Fold Boston in his heart
Till these echoes be choked with snows
Or over the town blue ocean flows
Boston Hymn
The word of the Lord by night
To the watching Pilgrims came
As they sat by the seaside
And filled their hearts with flame
God said I am tired of kings
I suffer them no more
Up to my ear the morning brings
The outrage of the poor
Think ye I made this ball
A field of havoc and war
Where tyrants great and tyrants small
Might harry the weak and poor
My angel his name is Freedom
Choose him to be your king
He shall cut pathways east and west
And fend you with his wing
Lo I uncover the land
Which I hid of old time in the West
As the sculptor uncovers the statue
When he has wrought his best
I show Columbia of the rocks
Which dip their foot in the seas
And soar to the airborne flocks
Of clouds and the boreal fleece
I will divide my goods
Call in the wretch and slave
None shall rule but the humble
And none but Toil shall have
I will have never a noble
No lineage counted great
Fishers and choppers and ploughmen
Shall constitute a state
Go cut down trees in the forest
And trim the straightest boughs
Cut down the trees in the forest
And build me a wooden house
Call the people together
The young men and the sires
The digger in the harvest field
Hireling and him that hires
And here in a pine statehouse
They shall choose men to rule
In every needful faculty
In church and state and school
Lo now if these poor men
Can govern the land and sea
And make just laws below the sun
As planets faithful be
And ye shall succour men
T is nobleness to serve
Help them who cannot help again
Beware from right to swerve
I break your bonds and masterships
And I unchain the slave
Free be his heart and hand henceforth
As wind and wandering wave
I cause from every creature
His proper good to flow
As much as he is and doeth
So much he shall bestow
But laying hands on another
To coin his labour and sweat
He goes in pawn to his victim
For eternal years in debt
Today unbind the captive
So only are ye unbound
Lift up a people from the dust
Trump of their rescue sound
Pay ransom to the owner
And fill the bag to the brim
Who is the owner The slave is owner
And ever was Pay him
O North give him beauty for rags
And honour O South for his shame
Nevada coin thy golden crags
With Freedoms image and name
Up and the dusky race
That sat in darkness long
Be swift their feet as antelopes
And as behemoth strong
Come East and West and North
By races as snowflakes
And carry my purpose forth
Which neither halts nor shakes
My will fulfilled shall be
For in daylight or in dark
My thunderbolt has eyes to see
His way home to the mark
Brahma
If the red slayer think he slays
Or if the slain think he is slain
They know not well the subtle ways
I keep and pass and turn again
Far or forgot to me is near
Shadow and sunlight are the same
The vanished gods to me appear
And one to me are shame and fame
They reckon ill who leave me out
When me they fly I am the wings
I am the doubter and the doubt
And I the hymn the Brahmin sings
The strong gods pine for my abode
And pine in vain the sacred Seven
But thou meek lover of the good
Find me and turn thy back on heaven
Celestial Love
Higher far
Upward into the pure realm
Over sun or star
Over the flickering Dmon film
Thou must mount for love
Into vision which all form
In one only form dissolves
In a region where the wheel
On which all beings ride
Visibly revolves
Where the starred eternal worm
Girds the world with bound and term
Where unlike things are like
When good and ill
And joy and moan
Melt into one
There Past Present Future shoot
Triple blossoms from one root
Substances at base divided
In their summits are united
There the holy Essence rolls
One through separated souls
And the sunny Aeligon sleeps
Folding nature in its deeps
And every fair and every good
Known in part or known impure
To men below
In their archetypes endure
The race of gods
Or those we erring own
Are shadows flitting up and down
In the still abodes
The circles of that sea are laws
Which publish and which hide the Cause
Pray for a beam
Out of that sphere
Thee to guide and to redeem
O what a load
Of care and toil
By lying Use bestowed
From his shoulders falls who sees
The true astronomy
The period of peace
Counsel which the ages kept
Shall the wellborn soul accept
As the overhanging trees
Fill the lake with images
As garment draws the garments hem
Men their fortunes bring with them
By right or wrong
Lands and goods go to the strong
Property will brutely draw
Still to the proprietor
Silver to silver creep and wind
And kind to kind
Nor less the eternal poles
Of tendency distribute souls
There need no vows to bind
Whom not each other seek but find
They give and take no pledge or oath
Nature is the bond of both
No prayer persuades no flattery fawns
Their noble meanings are their pawns
Plain and cold is their address
Power have they for tenderness
And so thoroughly is known
Each others purpose by his own
They can parley without meeting
Need is none of forms of greeting
They can well communicate
In their innermost estate
When each the other shall avoid
Shall each by each be most enjoyed
Not with scarfs or perfumed gloves
Do these celebrate their loves
Not by jewels feasts and savors
Not by ribbons or by favors
But by the sunspark on the sea
And the cloudshadow on the lea
The soothing lapse of morn to mirk
And the cheerful round of work
Their cords of love so public are
They intertwine the farthest star
The throbbing sea the quaking earth
Yield sympathy and signs of mirth
Is none so high so mean is none
But feels and seals this union
Even the tell Furies are appeased
The good applaud the lost are eased
Loves hearts are faithful but not fond
Bound for the just but not beyond
Not glad as the lowloving herd
Of self in others still preferred
But they have heartily designed
The benefit of broad mankind
And they serve men austerely
After their own genius clearly
Without a false humility
For this is loves nobility
Not to scatter bread and gold
Goods and raiment bought and sold
But to hold fast his simple sense
And speak the speech of innocence
And with hand and body and blood
To make his bosomcounsel good
For he that feeds men serveth few
He serves all who dares be true
Character
The sun set but set not his hope
Stars rose his faith was earlier up
Fixed on the enormous galaxy
Deeper and older seemed his eye
And matched his sufferance sublime
The taciturnity of time
He spoke and words more soft than rain
Brought the Age of Gold again
His action won such reverence sweet
As hid all measure of the feat
Compensation
Why should I keep holiday
When other men have none
Why but because when these are gay
I sit and mourn alone
And why when mirth unseals all tongues
Should mine alone be dumb
Ah late I spoke to silent throngs
And now their hour is come
Concord Hymn
By the rude bridge that arched the flood
Their flag to Aprils breeze unfurled
Here once the embattled farmers stood
And fired the shot heard round the world
The foe long since in silence slept
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps
And Time the ruined bridge has swept
Down the dark stream which seaward creeps
On this green bank by this soft stream
We set today a votive stone
That memory may their deed redeem
When like our sires our sons are gone
Spirit that made those heroes dare
To die and leave their children free
Bid Time and Nature gently spare
The shaft we raise to them and thee
Culture
Can rules or tutors educate
The semigod whom we await
He must be musical
Tremulous impressional
Alive to gentle influence
Of landscape and of sky
And tender to the spirittouch
Of mans or maidens eye
But to his native centre fast
Shall into Future fuse the Past
And the worlds flowing fates in his own mould recast
Demonic Love
Man was made of social earth
Child and brother from his birth
Tethered by a liquid cord
Of blood through veins of kindred poured
Next his heart the fireside band
Of mother father sister stand
Names from awful childhood heard
Throbs of a wild religion stirred
Their good was heaven their harm was vice
Till Beauty came to snap all ties
The maid abolishing the past
With lotuswine obliterates
Dear memorys stoneincarved traits
And by herself supplants alone
Friends year by year more inly known
When her calm eyes opened bright
All were foreign in their light
It was ever the selfsame tale
The old experience will not fail
Only two in the garden walked
And with snake and seraph talked
But God said
I will have a purer gift
There is smoke in the flame
New flowerets bring new prayers uplift
And love without a name
Fond children ye desire
To please each other well
Another round a higher
Ye shall climb on the heavenly stair
And selfish preference forbear
And in right deserving
And without a swerving
Each from your proper state
Weave roses for your mate
Deep deep are loving eyes
Flowed with naphtha fiery sweet
And the point is Paradise
Where their glances meet
Their reach shall yet be more profound
And a vision without bound
The axis of those eyes sunclear
Be the axis of the sphere
Then shall the lights ye pour amain
Go without check or intervals
Through from the empyrean walls
Unto the same again
Close close to men
Like undulating layer of air
Right above their heads
The potent plain of Dmons spreads
Stands to each human soul its own
For watch and ward and furtherance
In the snares of natures dance
And the lustre and the grace
Which fascinate each human heart
Beaming from another part
Translucent through the mortal covers
Is the Dmons form and face
To and fro the Genius hies
A gleam which plays and hovers
Over the maidens head
And dips sometimes as low as to her eyes
Unknown  albeit lying near
To men the path to the Dmon sphere
And they that swiftly come and go
Leave no track on the heavenly snow
Sometimes the airy synod bends
And the mighty choir descends
And the brains of men thenceforth
In crowded and in still resorts
Teem with unwonted thoughts
As when a shower of meteors
Cross the orbit of the earth
And lit by fringent air
Blaze near and far
Mortals deem the planets bright
Have slipped their sacred bars
And the lone seaman all the night
Sails astonished amid stars
Beauty of a richer vein
Graces of a subtler strain
Unto men these moonmen lend
And our shrinking sky extend
So is mans narrow path
By strength and terror skirted
Also from the song the wrath
Of the Genii be averted
The Muse the truth uncolored speaking
The Dmons are selfseeking
Their fierce and limitary will
Draws men to their likeness still
The erring painter made Love blind
Highest Love who shines on all
Him radiant sharpestsighted god
None can bewilder
Whose eyes pierce
The Universe
Pathfinder roadbuilder
Mediator royal giver
Rightlyseeing rightlyseen
Of joyful and transparent mien
Tis a sparkle passing
From each to each from me to thee
Perpetually
Sharing all daring all
Levelling misplacing
Each obstruction it unites
Equals remote and seeming opposites
And ever and forever Love
Delights to build a road
Unheeded Danger near him strides
Love laughs and on a lion rides
But Cupid wears another face
Born into Dmons less divine
His roses bleach apace
His nectar smacks of wine
The Dmon ever builds a wall
Himself incloses and includes
Solitude in solitudes
In like sort his love doth fall
He is an oligarch
He prizes wonder fame and mark
He loveth crowns
He scorneth drones
He doth elect
The beautiful and fortunate
And the sons of intellect
And the souls of ample fate
Who the Futures gates unbar
Minions of the Morning Star
In his prowess he exults
And the multitude insults
His impatient looks devour
Oft the humble and the poor
And seeing his eye glare
They drop their few pale flowers
Gathered with hope to please
Along the mountain towers
Lose courage and despair
He will never be gainsaid
Pitiless will not be stayed
His hot tyranny
Burns up every other tie
Therefore comes an hour from Jove
Which his ruthless will defies
And the dogs of Fate unties
Shiver the palaces of glass
Shrivel the rainbowcolored walls
Where in bright art each god and sibyl dwelt
Secure as in the Zodiacks belt
And the galleries and halls
Wherein every Siren sung
Like a meteor pass
For this fortune wanted root
In the core of Gods abysm
Was a weed of self and schism
And ever the Dmonic Love
Is the ancestor of wars
And the parent of remorse
Days
Daughters of Time the hypocritic Days
Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes
And marching single in an endless file
Bring diadems and fagots in their hands
To each they offer gifts after his will
Bread kingdom stars and sky that holds them all
I in my pleached garden watched the pomp
Forgot my morning wishes hastily
Took a few herbs and apples and the Day
Turned and departed silent I too late
Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn
Dirge
Knows he who tills this lonely field
To reap its scanty corn
What mystic fruit his acres yield
At midnight and at morn
In the long sunny afternoon
The plain was full of ghosts
I wandered up I wandered down
Beset by pensive hosts
The winding Concord gleamed below
Pouring as wide a flood
As when my brothers long ago
Came with me to the wood
But they are gone the holy ones
Who trod with me this lonely vale
The strong starbright companions
Are silent low and pale
My good my noble in their prime
Who made this world the feast it was
Who learned with me the lore of time
Who loved this dwellingplace
They took this valley for their toy
They played with it in every mood
A cell for prayer a hall for joy
They treated nature as they would
They colored the horizon round
Stars flamed and faded as they bade
All echoes hearkened for their sound
They made the woodlands glad or mad
I touch this flower of silken leaf
Which once our childhood knew
Its soft leaves wound me with a grief
Whose balsam never grew
Hearken to yon pine warbler
Singing aloft in the tree
Hearest thou O traveller
What he singeth to me
Not unless God made sharp thine ear
With sorrow such as mine
Out of that delicate lay couldst thou
The heavy dirge divine
Go lonely man it saith
They loved thee from their birth
Their hands were pure and pure their faith
There are no such hearts on earth
Ye drew one mothers milk
One chamber held ye all
A very tender history
Did in your childhood fall
Ye cannot unlock your heart
The key is gone with them
The silent organ loudest chants
The masters requiem
Each And All
Little thinks in the field yon redcloaked clown
Of thee from the hilltop looking down
And the heifer that lows in the upland farm
Farheard lows not thine ear to charm
The sexton tolling the bell at noon
Dreams not that great Napoleon
Stops his horse and lists with delight
Whilst his files sweep round yon Alpine height
Nor knowest thou what argument
Thy life to thy neighbors creed has lent
All are needed by each one
Nothing is fair or good alone
I thought the sparrows note from heaven
Singing at dawn on the alder bough
I brought him home in his nest at even
He sings the song but it pleases not now
For I did not bring home the river and sky
He sang to my ear they sang to my eye
The delicate shells lay on the shore
The bubbles of the latest wave
Fresh pearls to their enamel gave
And the bellowing of the savage sea
Greeted their safe escape to me
I wiped away the weeds and foam
And fetched my seaborn treasures home
But the poor unsightly noisome things
Had left their beauty on the shore
With the sun and the sand and the wild uproar
The lover watched his graceful maid
As mid the virgin train she strayed
Nor knew her beautys best attire
Was woven still by the snowwhite quire
At last she came to his hermitage
Like the bird from the woodlands to the cage
The gay enchantment was undone
A gentle wife but fairy none
Then I said I covet Truth
Beauty is unripe childhoods cheat
I leave it behind with the games of youth
As I spoke beneath my feet
The groundpine curled its pretty wreath
Running over the clubmoss burrs
I inhaled the violets breath
Around me stood the oaks and firs
Pine cones and acorns lay on the ground
Above me soared the eternal sky
Full of light and deity
Again I saw again I heard
The rolling river the morning bird
Beauty through my senses stole
I yielded myself to the perfect whole
Eros
The sense of the world is short
Long and various the report
To love and be beloved
Men and gods have not outlearned it
And how oft soeer theyve turned it
Tis not to be improved
Etienne de la Boece
I serve you not if you I follow
Shadowlike oer hill and hollow
And bend my fancy to your leading
All too nimble for my treading
When the pilgrimage is done
And weve the landscape overrun
I am bitter vacant thwarted
And your heart is unsupported
Vainly valiant you have missed
The manhood that should yours resist
Its complement but if I could
In severe or cordial mood
Lead you rightly to my altar
Where the wisest muses falter
And worship that worldwarning spark
Which dazzles me in midnight dark
Equalizing small and large
While the soul it doth surcharge
That the poor is wealthy grown
And the hermit never alone
The traveller and the road seem one
With the errand to be done
That were a mans and lovers part
That were Freedoms whitest chart
Experience
The lords of life the lords of life
I saw them pass
In their own guise
Like and unlike
Portly and grim
Use and Surprise
Surface and Dream
Succession swift and spectral Wrong
Temperament without a tongue
And the inventor of the game
Omnipresent without name
Some to see some to be guessed
They marched from east to west
Little man least of all
Among the legs of his guardians tall
Walked about with puzzled look
Him by the hand dear Nature took
Dearest Nature strong and kind
Whispered Darling never mind
Tomorrow they will wear another face
The founder thou these are thy race
Fable
The mountain and the squirrel
Had a quarrel
And the former called the latter Little Prig
Bun replied
You are doubtless very big
But all sorts of things and weather
Must be taken in together
To make up a year
And a sphere
And I think its no disgrace
To occupy my place
If Im not so large as you
You are not so small as I
And not half so spry
Ill not deny you make
A very pretty squirrel track
Talents differ all is well and wisely put
If I cannot carry forests on my back
Neither can you crack a nut
Fate
Deep in the man sits fast his fate
To mould his fortunes mean or great
Unknown to Cromwell as to me
Was Cromwells measure or degree
Unknown to him as to his horse
If he than his groom be better or worse
He works plots fights in rude affairs
With squires lords kings his craft compares
Till late he learned through doubt and fear
Broad England harbored not his peer
Obeying time the last to own
The Genius from its cloudy throne
For the prevision is allied
Unto the thing so signified
Or say the foresight that awaits
Is the same Genius that creates
Forebearance
Hast thou named all the birds without a gun
Loved the woodrose and left it on its stalk
At rich mens tables eaten bread and pulse
Unarmed faced danger with a heart of trust
And loved so well a high behavior
In man or maid that thou from speech refrained
Nobility more nobly to repay
O be my friend and teach me to be thine
Forerunners
Long I followed happy guides
I could never reach their sides
Their step is forth and ere the day
Breaks up their leaguer and away
Keen my sense my heart was young
Right goodwill my sinews strung
But no speed of mine avails
To hunt upon their shining trails
On and away their hasting feet
Make the morning proud and sweet
Flowers they strewI catch the scent
Or tone of silver instrument
Leaves on the wind melodious trace
Yet I could never see their face
On eastern hills I see their smokes
Mixed with mist by distant lochs
I met many travellers
Who the road had surely kept
They saw not my fine revellers
These had crossed them while they slept
Some had heard their fair report
In the country or the court
Fleetest couriers alive
Never yet could once arrive
As they went or they returned
At the house where these sojourned
Sometimes their strong speed they slacken
Though they are not overtaken
In sleep their jubilant troop is near
I tuneful voices overhear
It may be in wood or waste
At unawares t is come and past
Their near camp my spirit knows
By signs gracious as rainbows
I thenceforward and long after
Listen for their harplike laughter
And carry in my heart for days
Peace that hallows rudest ways
Freedom
Once I wished I might rehearse
Freedoms paean in my verse
That the slave who caught the strain
Should throb until he snapped his chain
But the Spirit said Not so
Speak it not or speak it low
Name not lightly to be said
Gift too precious to be prayed
Passion not to be expressed
But by heaving of the breast
Yetwouldst thou the mountain find
Where this deity is shrined
Who gives to seas and sunset skies
Their unspent beauty of surprise
And when it lists him waken can
Brute or savage into man
Or if in thy heart he shine
Blends the starry fates with thine
Draws angels nigh to dwell with thee
And makes thy thoughts archangels be
Freedoms secret wilt thou know
Counsel not with flesh and blood
Loiter not for cloak or food
Right thou feelest rush to do
Friendship
A ruddy drop of manly blood
The surging sea outweighs
The world uncertain comes and goes
The lover rooted stays
I fancied he was fled
And after many a year
Glowed unexhausted kindliness
Like daily sunrise there
My careful heart was free again
O friend my bosom said
Through thee alone the sky is arched
Through thee the rose is red
All things through thee take nobler form
And look beyond the earth
The millround of our fate appears
A sunpath in thy worth
Me too thy nobleness had taught
To master my despair
The fountains of my hidden life
Are through thy friendship fair
From the Persian of Hafiz I
Butler fetch the ruby wine
Which with sudden greatness fills us
Pour for me who in my spirit
Fail in courage and performance
Bring the philosophic stone
Karuns treasure Noahs life
Haste that by thy means I open
All the doors of luck and life
Bring me boy the firewater
Zoroaster sought in dust
To Hafiz revelling tis allowed
To pray to Matter and to Fire
Bring the wine of Jamschids glass
That shone ere time was in the Neant
Give it me that through its virtue
I as Jamschid see through worlds
Wisely said the Kaiser Jamschid
This worlds not worth a barleycorn
Bring me boy the nectar cup
Since it leads to Paradise
Flute and lyre lordly speak
Lees of wine outvalue crowns
Hither bring the veiled beauty
Who in illfamed houses sits
Lead her forth my honest name
Freely barter I for wine
Bring me boy the firewater
Drinks the lionthe woods burn
Give it me that I storm heaven
Tear the net from the archwolf
Wine wherewith the Houris teach
Angels the ways of Paradise
On the glowing coals Ill set it
And therewith my brain perfume
Bring me wine through whose effulgence
Jam and Chosroes yielded light
Wine that to the flute I sing
Where is Jam and where is Kauss
Bring the blessing of old times
Bless the old departed Shahs
Bring it me the Shah of hearts
Bring me wine to wash me clean
Of the weatherstains of care
See the countenance of luck
While I dwell in spiritgardens
Wherefore sit I shackled here
Lo this mirror shows me all
Drunk I speak of purity
Beggar I of lordship speak
When Hafiz in his revel sings
Shouteth Sohra in her sphere
Fear the changes of a day
Bring wine which increases life
Since the world is all untrue
Let the trumpets thee remind
How the crown of Kobad vanished
Be not certain of the world
Twill not spare to shed thy blood
Desperate of the worlds affair
Came I running to the winehouse
Give me wine which maketh glad
That I may my steed bestride
Through the course career with Rustem
Gallop to my hearts content
Give me boy the ruby cup
Which unlocks the heart with wine
That I reason quite renounce
And plant banners on the worlds
Let us make our glasses kiss
Let us quench the sorrowcinders
Today let us drink together
Whoso has a banquet dressed
Is with glad mind satisfied
Scaping from the snares of Dews
Alas for youth tis gone in wind
Happy he who spent it well
Give me wine that I oerleap
Both worlds at a single spring
Stole at dawn from glowing spheres
Call of Houris to mine ear
O happy bird delicious soul
Spread thy pinion break the cage
Sit on the roof of the seven domes
Where the spirit takes repose
In the time of Bisurdschimihr
Menutschehers beauty shined
On the beaker of Nushirvan
Wrote they once in eider times
Hear the Counsel learn from us
Sample of the course of things
Earth it is a place of sorrow
Scanty joys are here below
Who has nothing has no sorrow
Where is Jam and where his cup
Solomon and his mirror where
Which of the wise masters knows
What time Kauss and Jam existed
When those heroes left this world
Left they nothing but their names
Bind thy heart not to the earth
When thou goest come not back
Fools squander on the world their hearts
League with it is feud with heaven
Never gives it what thou wishest
A cup of wine imparts the sight
Of the five heavendomes with nine steps
Whoso can himself renounce
Without support shall walk thereon
Who discreet is is not wise
Give me boy the Kaiser cup
Which rejoices heart and soul
Under type of wine and cup
Signify we purest love
Youth like lightning disappears
Life goes by us as the wind
Leave the dwelling with six doors
And the serpent with nine heads
Life and silver spend thou freely
If thou honorest the soul
Haste into the other life
All is nought save God alone
Give me boy this toy of dmons
When the cup of Jam was lost
Him availed the world no more
Fetch the wineglass made of ice
Wake the torpid heart with wine
Every clod of loam below us
Is a skull of Alexander
Oceans are the blood of princes
Desert sands the dust of beauties
More than one Darius was there
Who the whole world overcame
But since these gave up the ghost
Thinkest thou they never were
Boy go from me to the Shah
Say to him Shah crowned as Jam
Win thou first the poor mans heart
Then the glass so know the world
Empty sorrows from the earth
Canst thou drive away with wine
Now in thy thrones recent beauty
In the flowing tide of power
Moon of fortune mighty king
Whose tiara sheddeth lustre
Peace secure to fish and fowl
Heart and eyesparkle to saints
Shoreless is the sea of praise
I content me with a prayer
From Nisamis poetworks
Highest ornament of speech
Here a verse will I recite
Verse as beautiful as pearls
More kingdoms wait thy diadem
Than are known to thee by name
May the sovran destiny
Grant a victory every morn
From the Persian of Hafiz II
Of Paradise O hermit wise
Let us renounce the thought
Of old therein our names of sin
Allah recorded not
Who dear to God on earthly sod
No corngrain plants
The same is glad that life is had
Though corn he wants
Thy mind the mosque and cool kiosk
Spare fast and orisons
Mine me allows the drinkhouse
And sweet chase of the nuns
O just fakeer with brow austere
Forbid me not the vine
On the first day poor Hafiz clay
Was kneaded up with wine
He is no dervise Heaven slights his service
Who shall refuse
There in the banquet to pawn his blanket
For Schirazs juice
Who his friends shirt or hem of his shirt
Shall spare to pledge
To him Edens bliss and Angels kiss
Shall want their edge
Up Hafiz grace from high Gods face
Beams on thee pure
Shy then not hell and trust thou well
Heaven is secure
Give All To Love
Give all to love
Obey thy heart
Friends kindred days
Estate goodfame
Plans credit and the Muse
Nothing refuse
Tis a brave master
Let it have scope
Follow it utterly
Hope beyond hope
High and more high
It dives into noon
With wing unspent
Untold intent
But it is a god
Knows its own path
And the outlets of the sky
It was not for the mean
It requireth courage stout
Souls above doubt
Valor unbending
It will reward
They shall return
More than they were
And ever ascending
Leave all for love
Yet hear me yet
One word more thy heart behoved
One pulse more of firm endeavor
Keep thee today
Tomorrow forever
Free as an Arab
Of thy beloved
Cling with life to the maid
But when the surprise
First vague shadow of surmise
Flits across her bosom young
Of a joy apart from thee
Free be she fancyfree
Nor thou detain her vestures hem
Nor the palest rose she flung
From her summer diadem
Goodbye
Goodbye proud world Im going home
Thourt not my friend and Im not thine
Long through thy weary crowds I roam
A riverark on the ocean brine
Long Ive been tossed like the driven foam
But now proud world Im going home
Goodby to Flatterys fawning face
To Grandeur with his wise grimace
To upstart Wealths averted eye
To supple Office low and high
To crowded halls to court and street
To frozen hearts and hasting feet
To those who go and those who come
Goodby proud world Im going home
Im going to my own hearthstone
Bosomed in yon green hills alone
A secret nook in a pleasant land
Whose groves the frolic fairies planned
Where arches green the livelong day
Echo the blackbirds roundelay
And vulgar feet have never trod
A spot that is sacred to thought and God
Oh when I am safe in my sylvan home
I tread on the pride of Greece and Rome
And when I am stretched beneath the pines
Where the evening star so holy shines
I laugh at the lore and the pride of man
At the sophist schools and the learned clan
For what are they all in their high conceit
When man in the bush with God may meet
Grace
How much preventing God how much I owe
To the defenses thou hast round me set
Example custom fear occasional slow
These scorned bondmen were my parapet
I dare not peep over this parapet
To gauge with glance the roaring gulf beelow
The depths of sin to which I had descended
Had not these me against myself defended
Guy
Mortal mixed of middle clay
Attempered to the night and day
Interchangeable with things
Needs no amulets nor rings
Guy possessed the talisman
That all things from him began
And as of old Polycrates
Chained the sunshine and the breeze
So did Guy betimes discover
Fortune was his guard and lover
In strange junctures felt with awe
His own symmetry with law
That no mixture could withstand
The virtue of his lucky hand
He gold or jewel could not lose
Nor not receive his ample dues
In the street if he turned round
His eye the eye twas seeking found
It seemed his Genius discreet
Worked on the Makers own receipt
And made each tide and element
Stewards of stipend and of rent
So that the common waters fell
As costly wine into his well
He had so sped his wise affairs
That he caught nature in his snares
Early or late the falling rain
Arrived in time to swell his grain
Stream could not so perversely wind
But corn of Guys was there to grind
The whirlwind found it on its way
To speed his sails to dry his hay
And the worlds sun seemed to rise
To drudge all day for Guy the wise
In his rich nurseries timely skill
Strong crab with nobler blood did fill
The Zephyr in his garden rolled
From plum trees vegetable gold
And all the hours of the year
With their own harvest hovered were
There was no frost but welcome came
Nor freshet nor midsummer flame
Belonged to wind and world the toil
And venture and to Guy the oil
Hamatreya
Bulkeley Hunt Willard Hosmer Meriam Flint
Possessed the land which rendered to their toil
Hay corn roots hemp flax apples wool and wood
Each of these landlords walked amidst his farm
Saying Tis mine my childrens and my names
How sweet the west wind sounds in my own trees
How graceful climb those shadows on my hill
I fancy these pure waters and the flags
Know me as does my dog we sympathize
And I affirm my actions smack of the soil
Where are these men Asleep beneath their grounds
And strangers fond as they their furrows plough
Earth laughs in flowers to see her boastful boys
Earthproud proud of the earth which is not theirs
Who steer the plough but cannot steer their feet
Clear of the grave
They added ridge to valley brook to pond
And sighed for all that bounded their domain
This suits me for a pasture thats my park
We must have clay lime gravel graniteledge
And misty lowland where to go for peat
The land is welllies fairly to the south
Tis good when you have crossed the sea and back
To find the sitfast acres where you left them
Ah the hot owner sees not Death who adds
Him to his land a lump of mould the more
Hear what the Earth says
EarthSong
Mine and yours
Mine not yours Earth endures
Stars abide
Shine down in the old sea
Old are the shores
But where are old men
I who have seen much
Such have I never seen
The lawyers deed
Ran sure
In tail
To them and to their heirs
Who shall succeed
Without fail
Forevermore
Here is the land
Shaggy with wood
With its old valley
Mound and flood
But the heritors
Fled like the floods foam
The lawyer and the laws
And the kingdom
Clean swept herefrom
They called me theirs
Who so controlled me
Yet every one
Wished to stay and is gone
How am I theirs
If they cannot hold me
But I hold them
When I heard the Earthsong
I was no longer brave
My avarice cooled
Like lust in the chill of the grave
Heroism
Ruby wine is drunk by knaves
Sugar spends to fatten slaves
Rose and vineleaf deck buffoons
Thunderclouds are Joves festoons
Drooping oft in wreaths of dread
Lightningknotted round his head
The hero is not fed on sweets
Daily his own heart he eats
Chambers of the great are jails
And headwinds right for royal sails
In Memoriam
I mourn upon this battlefield
But not for those who perished here
Behold the riverbank
Whither the angry farmers came
In sloven dress and broken rank
Nor thought of fame
Their deed of blood
All mankind praise
Even the serene Reason says
It was well done
The wise and simple have one glance
To greet yon stern headstone
Which more of pride than pity gave
To mark the Britons friendless grave
Yet it is a stately tomb
The grand return
Of eve and morn
The years fresh bloom
The silver cloud
Might grace the dust that is most proud
Yet not of these I muse
In this ancestral place
But of a kindred face
That never joy or hope shall here diffuse
Ah brother of the brief but blazing star
What hast thou to do with these
Haunting this banks historic trees
Thou born for noblest life
For actions field for victors car
Thou living champion of the right
To these their penalty belonged
I grudge not these their bed of death
But thine to thee who never wronged
The poorest that drew breath
All inborn power that could
Consist with homage to the good
Flamed from his martial eye
He who seemed a soldier born
He should have the helmet worn
All friends to fend all foes defy
Fronting foes of God and man
Frowning down the evildoer
Battling for the weak and poor
His from youth the leaders look
Gave the law which others took
And never poor beseeching glance
Shamed that sculptured countenance
There is no record left on earth
Save in tablets of the heart
Of the rich inherent worth
Of the grace that on him shone
Of eloquent lips of joyful wit
He could not frame a word unfit
An act unworthy to be done
Honour prompted every glance
Honour came and sat beside him
In lowly cot or painful road
And evermore the cruel god
Cried Onward and the palmcrown showed
Born for success he seemed
With grace to win with heart to hold
With shining gifts that took all eyes
With budding power in collegehalls
As pledged in coming days to forge
Weapons to guard the State or scourge
Tyrants despite their guards or walls
On his young promise Beauty smiled
Drew his free homage unbeguiled
And prosperous Age held out his hand
And richly his large future planned
And troops of friends enjoyed the tide
All all was given and only health denied
I see him with superior smile
Hunted by Sorrows grisly train
In lands remote in toil and pain
With angel patience labour on
With the high port he wore erewhile
When foremost of the youthful band
The prizes in all lists he won
Nor bate one jot of heart or hope
And least of all the loyal tie
Which holds to home neath every sky
The joy and pride the pilgrim feels
In hearts which round the hearth at home
Keep pulse for pulse with those who roam
What generous beliefs console
The brave whom Fate denies the goal
If others reach it is content
To Heavens high will his will is bent
Firm on his heart relied
What lot soeer betide
Work of his hand
He nor repents nor grieves
Pleads for itself the fact
As unrepenting Nature leaves
Her every act
Fell the bolt on the branching oak
The rainbow of his hope was broke
No craven cry no secret tear
He told no pang he knew no fear
Its peace sublime his aspect kept
His purpose woke his features slept
And yet between the spasms of pain
His genius beamed with joy again
Oer thy rich dust the endless smile
Of Nature in thy Spanish isle
Hints never loss or cruel break
And sacrifice for loves dear sake
Nor mourn the unalterable Days
That Genius goes and Folly stays
What matters how or from what ground
The freed soul its Creator found
Alike thy memory embalms
That orangegrove that isle of palms
And these loved banks whose oakboughs bold
Root in the blood of heroes old
Letters
Every day brings a ship
Every ship brings a word
Well for those who have no fear
Looking seaward well assured
That the word the vessel brings
Is the word they wish to hear
Loss And Gain
Virtue runs before the muse
And defies her skill
She is rapt and doth refuse
To wait a painters will
Staradoring occupied
Virtue cannot bend her
Just to please a poets pride
To parade her splendor
The bard must be with good intent
No more his but hers
Throw away his pen and paint
Kneel with worshippers
Then perchance a sunny ray
From the heaven of fire
His lost tools may overpay
And better his desire
Love And Thought
Two wellassorted travellers use
The highway Eros and the Muse
From the twins is nothing hidden
To the pair is naught forbidden
Hand in hand the comrades go
Every nook of nature through
Each for other they were born
Each can other best adorn
They know one only mortal grief
Past all balsam or relief
When by false companions crossed
The pilgrims have each other lost
`
